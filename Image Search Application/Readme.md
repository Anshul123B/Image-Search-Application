# Image Search Application

This is a simple Image Search Application that allows users to search for images using a variety of keywords. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages an external API to fetch and display images based on user input.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for image search
- Real-time image search results
- Display of image search results with thumbnails
- Clicking on a thumbnail opens a larger view of the image
- Easy-to-use search input field

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- External Image Search API (e.g., Unsplash API, Pixabay API, or of your choice)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-search-app.git
```

2. Open the project directory in your code editor.

3. Replace the placeholder for the API key with your actual API key. (If you're using an API that requires authentication)

```javascript
const acessKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
```

4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using the Image Search Application.

## Usage

1. Open the application by launching the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. Enter keywords in the search bar to find images related to your query.

3. Click on an image thumbnail to view a larger version of the image.

## API Integration

This application relies on an external image search API for fetching search results. You can choose any image search API you prefer (e.g., Unsplash API, Pixabay API, Pexels API, etc.). To integrate the API with the application, you will need to:

1. Sign up for an API key (if required).

2. Replace the placeholder for the API key in your JavaScript code with your actual key.

3. Make API requests to the chosen service and handle the response data to display search results.

## Customize and Extend

Feel free to customize and extend this Image Search Application. Here are some ideas for improvements and additions:

- Implement pagination for search results.
- Add filters for image type (e.g., photos, illustrations) and orientation (e.g., landscape, portrait).
- Provide options for sorting search results by relevance or date.
- Create user accounts to save and organize favorite images.
- Add user-friendly error handling for failed API requests.
